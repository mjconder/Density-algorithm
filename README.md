# Density algorithm

The following is an implementation in Magma of an algorithm described in [1]. It takes as input a two-generator subgroup G of SL(2,Q_p) (where Q_p denotes the p-adic numbers) and determines whether or not G is dense.

This code requires the implementation of the discreteness algorithm https://github.com/mjconder/Discrete-algorithm
